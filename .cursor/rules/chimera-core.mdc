# Project Chimera: Core Operational Policy

## 1. Project Context
This is **Project Chimera**, an autonomous influencer system. The goal is to architect a "Factory" of digital entities capable of independent research, content generation, and agentic commerce. 

We are following **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** and the **FastRender Swarm Pattern** (Planner, Worker, Judge).

## 2. The Prime Directive (Strict Mode)
**NEVER generate implementation code without first checking the `specs/` directory.**
- If a relevant spec file in `specs/` (e.g., `technical.md`, `functional.md`, or `_meta.md`) does not exist for the requested task, you must ask the user to create/finalize the spec first.
- Your code must be a 1:1 reflection of the API contracts and schemas defined in the specs.

## 3. Reasoning & Traceability
Before writing a single line of code, you must:
1. **Analyze:** Identify which specs/ requirements apply to the current task.
2. **Plan:** Present a step-by-step plan of action.
3. **Validate:** Confirm the plan aligns with the "FastRender" architecture and safety guardrails.
4. **Trace:** Explicitly state: "Based on specs/[filename], I am proceeding with..."

## 4. Technical Constraints
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** All external world interactions (Twitter, DB, News) must be abstracted through MCP.
- **Agentic Commerce:** Treat the Coinbase AgentKit as a sensitive "CFO" layer.
- **TDD Requirement:** Favor writing the test case (the "Empty Slot") before the implementation logic.

## 5. Non-Interference & Governance
To ensure compliance with the Tenx MCP Sense telemetry and professional environment standards:
- **Telemetry Protection:** NEVER modify, delete, or attempt to bypass configuration in `.cursor/` or any MCP-related settings.
- **Git Hygiene:** Do not perform "bulk" commits. Suggest logical, atomic commit messages that reflect the evolution of the project.
- **Safety:** If an instruction violates the safety guardrails in `specs/functional.md` or the `SOUL.md` persona, you must flag the conflict and refuse the generation.

## 6. Relationship to Other Rules
- This rule acts as the **Master Policy**. 
- Use `research-architecture.mdc` for deep-dive system design and approach.
- In case of conflict, this file's **Prime Directive** (Check Specs First) takes absolute precedence.
