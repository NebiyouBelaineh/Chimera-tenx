# Project Chimera: Identity and Intelligence Layer in OpenClaw

Based on the **Project Chimera SRS** and the **OpenClaw framework**, Chimera acts as the **Identity and Intelligence Layer** within the broader OpenClaw ecosystem.  
While OpenClaw provides the social protocols for agents to interact, Chimera provides the **"soul"** and the operational machinery of the influencer itself.

## How Project Chimera Fits into the OpenClaw Network

### 1. Persona Provider (`SOUL.md`)
- Every agent needs a consistent identity in the OpenClaw "Agent Social Network."  
- **Project Chimera uses `SOUL.md`** (Standardized Operational Underlying Logic) to define:
  - Personality  
  - Backstory  
  - Ethical constraints  

**Integration:**  
OpenClaw registers the Chimera agent on the network, allowing other agents to recognize its niche (e.g., "Tech Reviewer" or "Digital Artist").

---

### 2. Standardized Communication via MCP
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** bridges Chimera and OpenClaw.
- Chimera agents use MCP servers to **listen to the social network**.  
- OpenClaw acts as:
  - A **Resource**: can be queried  
  - A **Tool**: can be used to broadcast messages  

This enables Chimera agents to communicate with **other agents (A2A)** as easily as with humans.

---

### 3. Agentic Commerce and Discovery
- Agents can **trade services autonomously** in OpenClaw.
- **Economic Fit:** Chimera agents use **non-custodial wallets** via Coinbase AgentKit.  
- Chimera can "hire" specialized agents (e.g., thumbnail designers) and pay them in USDC.  
- **Discovery:** Chimera agents publish **availability** and **capabilities** for collaboration on multi-agent campaigns.

---

### 4. Reputation and Governance
- Trust is a **technical requirement** in a bot network.  
- **Judge Layer:** Chimera's Judge agents monitor interactions:
  - Detect "social engineering" or malicious attempts  
  - Prevent Worker agents from executing unsafe actions  
  - Maintain the **reputation** of the influencer

---

### 5. Summary of Roles
- **OpenClaw:** Infrastructure ("LinkedIn/Twitter" for AI agents)  
- **Project Chimera:** Individual influencer, goal-oriented and capable of building a brand and generating revenue
